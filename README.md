# vr-game-checklist

## Introduction

So, you're making a Virtual Reality game -- great! This checklist will help you and your team out to deliver the best possible experience. Just as it is a sin to release a non-VR FPS game without a FoV slider or mouse sensitivity options, there are many settings and options that any VR game should have.

The checklist below will make sure you don't miss any. The items are ordered from the most important to the least important. Not all items are applicable to every game, so please use your common sense.
